# Inflammasome-related-gene-regulation-in-PKDL-and-VL
##This study aims to understand the crucial inflammasome-related markers that potentially influence the pathogenesis of visceral (VL) and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL).Additionally, we have also tried to comprehend the potential regulatory mechanisms through which intracellular Leishmania parasites modulate these cytosolic inflammasome markers while residing within parasitophorous vacuoles, secluded from the host cytoplasm.

This repository contains the R codes, that have been used to analyze the datasets, and the excel sheets containing differentially expressed gene list and functionally annotated inflammasome related genes as mentioned. The file names are descriptive of the datsets that is being analyzed.
